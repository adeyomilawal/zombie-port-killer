## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` type - use proper types
- Export interfaces for public APIs
- Document complex functions with JSDoc

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Find process using a specific port
 * @param port - Port number (1-65535)
 * @returns ProcessInfo or null if port is not in use
 */
async findByPort(port: number): Promise<ProcessInfo | null> {
  this.validatePort(port);
  return await this.adapter.findProcessByPort(port);
}
```

### Code Style

- **Indentation:** 2 spaces
- **Line length:** Max 80 characters (soft limit)
- **Quotes:** Single quotes for strings
- **Semicolons:** Required
- **Naming:**
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and types
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

### File Organization

- One class per file
- Group related functionality
- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`)

### Error Handling

```typescript
// Good: Specific error handling
try {
  await killProcess(pid);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === "EACCES") {
    throw new Error("Permission denied. Try: sudo zkill 3000");
  }
  throw error;
}

// Bad: Generic error handling
try {
  await killProcess(pid);
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error");
}
```

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- All new features must have tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Tests must pass on all platforms

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("ProcessService", () => {
  describe("findByPort", () => {
    it("should find process on active port", async () => {
      // Arrange
      const service = new ProcessService();
      const port = 3000;

      // Act
      const result = await service.findByPort(port);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(result?.port).toBe(port);
    });

    it("should return null for unused port", async () => {
      const service = new ProcessService();
      const result = await service.findByPort(9999);
      expect(result).toBeNull();
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- process.service.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Platform-Specific Development

### Testing on Multiple Platforms

If you're developing platform-specific features:

1. **Test locally** on your platform
2. **Document** which platforms you've tested on
3. **Request testing** from maintainers on other platforms

### Platform Adapters

When modifying platform adapters:

- Maintain consistent API across all platforms
- Handle platform-specific edge cases
- Add platform-specific tests

---

## Documentation

### When to Update Documentation

- Adding new features → Update README
- Changing CLI commands → Update README and docs
- Fixing bugs → Update CHANGELOG
- API changes → Update code comments

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, simple language
- Provide examples
- Keep it up to date
- Use proper Markdown formatting
