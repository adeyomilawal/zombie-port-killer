## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage

✅ **Do:**

- Keep zkill updated to the latest version
- Review process details before killing
- Use `--force` flag carefully
- Check auto-kill configuration regularly

❌ **Don't:**

- Run zkill with `sudo` unless necessary
- Kill system processes without understanding impact
- Disable confirmation prompts in production
- Share your configuration with untrusted users

### Permission Management

```bash
# Good: Run as normal user for dev processes
zkill 3000

# Good: Use sudo only when needed
sudo zkill 80

# Bad: Running everything as root
sudo su
zkill 3000  # Unnecessary elevated permissions
```

---

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Elevated Privileges

**Risk:** Running zkill with `sudo` gives it power to kill any process.

**Mitigation:**

- Only use `sudo` when necessary
- Review process details before confirming
- System process warnings are shown

### 2. Configuration File Security

**Location:** `~/.zkill/config.json`

**Risk:** Configuration file could be read by other users.

**Mitigation:**

- File has user-only permissions (0600)
- No sensitive data stored in config
- No credentials or tokens

### 3. Process Information Disclosure

**Risk:** `zkill scan` shows process information.

**Mitigation:**

- Only shows processes owned by current user (unless sudo)
- No sensitive data in output
- Process details already available via `ps` command

### 4. Auto-Kill Feature

**Risk:** Automatic process termination could kill unintended processes.

**Mitigation:**

- Confirmation required by default
- Clear warnings shown
- Can be disabled anytime
- Only kills processes from tracked projects
